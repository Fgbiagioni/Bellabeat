# Bellabeat
Quick Summary: In this opportunity, I will be showing my Bellabeat analysis case study, with SQL and Power BI.

# Introduction
For this project, I will take the role of a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women. This is a case presented by Google Career Certificates for the Data Analytics specialization. 
According to the case, Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. I have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. 
Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.
